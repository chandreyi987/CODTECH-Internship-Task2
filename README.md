Objective of the Program:

The objective of this Java-based Library Management System is to develop a software application that can effectively manage library resources, such as books, magazines, and DVDs. The program allows librarians to add items to the system and patrons to interact with those items by viewing, checking out, and returning them. The system also implements role-based functionalities and ensures data persistence through file handling, making it functional across multiple sessions.

Purpose of the Program:

The purpose of the program is to provide an easy-to-use and efficient solution for managing library resources. Key aspects of the system include:

1. Centralized Management: The program offers a centralized platform where librarians can add new items (books, magazines, DVDs) and maintain control over library resources.


2. Role-Based Access: The system ensures that specific functionalities are restricted based on user roles, allowing librarians to manage inventory while giving patrons limited access for viewing, checking out, and returning items.


3. Persistence of Data: By using file handling techniques, the system saves all data to a file, ensuring that library records are retained even after the program is closed. This allows continuity of library operations across multiple sessions.


4. User-Friendly Interaction: The system provides a simple command-line interface where users can easily navigate options like adding items, checking availability, checking out, and returning items.


5. Automation of Library Tasks: This system automates many manual tasks, reducing human error and making library management more efficient by handling item status, tracking checkouts, and ensuring the availability of resources for patrons.



In summary, this program aims to streamline library operations, facilitate seamless interaction between users (librarians and patrons), and provide a practical and reliable system for managing various library resources.
